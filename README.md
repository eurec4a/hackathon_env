# hackathon environment

This is a repository for setting up a [repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) environment for the EUREC4A hackathon code samples.
The environment setup is split into a separate repository as recommended by [this jupyter discourse post](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/tip-speed-up-binder-launches-by-pulling-github-content-in-a-binder-link-with-nbgitpuller/922), as the environment has a substantial ammount of dependences and rebuilding these dependences whenever a blog post is changed would take a lot more time than necessary.

## tools
If you want to run your own repository in this environment, have a look at [nbgitpuller.link](http://nbgitpuller.link/?tab=binder&repo=https://github.com/eurec4a/hackathon_env) for setting it up.
